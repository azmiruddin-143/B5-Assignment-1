# What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
## Both interface and type are used to define the structure of data. That is, they are useful for describing what an object or data will look like.
## Answere
- If you only want to create the structure of an object, then it is better to use Interface.

- And if you have to work with many types (such as union, intersection) then it is better to use type

# Example
## ðŸ§© Interface Example

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user1: User = {
  name: "Azmir",
  age: 20
};
```

## ðŸ”— Type Alias Example

```ts
type ID = string | number;
```

## ðŸ§¬ Intersection Type Example

```ts
type Admin = {
  name: string;
  role: string;
};

type SuperAdmin = Admin & { accessLevel: number };

const admin1: SuperAdmin = {
  name: "Azmir Uddin",
  role: "Manager",
  accessLevel: 5
};
```
